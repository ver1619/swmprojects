# Grading-Report Program
**This program is designed to generate a detailed student report-card based on user input**

+ When run, specific inputs are needed(student name,reg.no,class,marks)
+ Based on the inputs, the code calculates total marks by summing up all 5 subject's marks.
+ With total marks the percentage is calculated too.
+ Then based on the percentage specific grades are alloted(e.g, 'A' for students who scored above 90).
+ At last a complete report is displayed with all the details(student name,reg.no,class,total marks,percentage).
+ With Pass / Fail (e.g, Fail if Percentage < 40)
